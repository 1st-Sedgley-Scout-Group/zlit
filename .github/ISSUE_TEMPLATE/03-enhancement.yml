    attributes:
      label: Current behavior
      description: Briefly describe the existing behavior or limitations that the enhancement aims to address.
      placeholder: The existing code is limited to displaying basic vertical lines and lacks the functionality to dynamically reposition annotations along the line

    id: enhanced-behaviour
    attributes: 
      label: Enhanced behavior
      description: Clearly outline the desired improvements or changes resulting from the enhancement.
      placeholder: The code should determine the optimal position for the annotation along the line and automatically place it at that location

    id: commission-value
    attributes: 
      label: Commission and impact/value
      description: Who commissioned the enhancement? Discuss the significance of the enhancement, considering factors such as its impact on users, potential benefits, or added value to the project.

      label: Proposed solution
      description: If you have specific ideas on how to implement the enhancement, provide details on the proposed solution. Include any technical considerations, design principles, or implementation strategies.
      placeholder: A potential solution is to analyze the positions of other data visualizations on the chart and identify the nearest data point or cap. Additionally, we would need to compute the appropriate size for the annotation box to ensure it seamlessly fits into the identified location.
